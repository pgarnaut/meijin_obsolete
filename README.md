Meijin - a wacky computer go engine

For development related info, please refer to https://github.com/patmanpato/meijin/wiki


Running:
--
(Only tested with python 3.2)

with a gui client (tested with GoGui on windows and linux), use the command:
python main.py --engine

to play against it on the command line (similar to default GnuGo behaviour):
python main.py --human

to run a file of gtp commands over the engine:
python main.py --test <some filename>

(of course you could just cat/redirect the file over stdin and use --engine)

How it works:
--
...
.....
....... sadly, it doesn't. Yet.

Engines better than Meijin:
--
... all of them.
